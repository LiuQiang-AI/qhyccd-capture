# qhyccd-capture

## Project Introduction

`qhyccd-capture` is a basic operation library for handling QHYCCD series cameras. This library provides functionalities to interact with QHYCCD cameras, including camera connection, parameter setting, image capture, and display. This project is a [napari] plugin, aimed at simplifying the use of the camera through a graphical user interface.

## Features

- **Camera Connection**: Supports loading the corresponding QHYCCD dynamic link libraries on different operating systems (such as Windows, Linux, macOS) and initializing camera resources.
- **Parameter Setting**: Provides the functionality to set camera parameters, such as exposure time, gain, offset, USB bandwidth, etc.
- **Image Capture**: Supports single-frame mode exposure and retrieves image data.
- **Image Display**: Displays captured images through napari, supports distributed display, single display, and sequence display modes.
- **Histogram and White Balance**: Provides histogram equalization and white balance adjustment functions.
- **ROI (Region of Interest)**: Supports creating and applying ROIs to operate on specific areas.
- **Video Recording**: Supports video recording and saves in various video formats.
- **Temperature Control**: Supports temperature control and displays temperature.
- **CFW Control**: Supports CFW control and displays CFW status.
- **Star Point Resolution**: Supports star point resolution and displays the results.
